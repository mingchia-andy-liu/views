This is a simple project for me to track the number of visit on my site without a crazy GA setup. I just need something that track the count and return to me the total. Also, some of the analaytics tracking tool are blocked by ad-blockers or requires javascript enabled.

I want a tool that is easy and somewhat accurate. I use durable object to see what it can do as I've used other tech from Cloudflare before.

The current production is powered by KV which is eventual consistent. I do not need a real-time view count. You can use Durable Object which is also supported by commenting out the KV section.

### 🚀 Usage

⚠️ The count does not reflect actual user visit, it just a number that keeps growing, use at your own risk!

Markdown
```md

```

### 🛠 Options

| Option | Required | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| page | Yes | string | The target url to be tracked |
| style | No | 'text' \| 'badge' | Default `badge`. `text` will only how the count as plain text |
| label | No | string | The label text of the badge. By default it will use the `page` value  |
